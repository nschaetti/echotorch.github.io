## Reservoir Computing and time series analysis made simple

EchoTorch is a Python package which allow you to easily implement Reservoir Computing
models such as Echo State Networks, more complex ones such as Conceptors and 
DeepESN but also all neural network models working on timeseries. EchoTorch is a 
PyTorch for Reservoir Computing and timeseries analysis.
