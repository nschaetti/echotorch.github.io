EchoTorch is a Python package intended to simplify the evaluation and implementation of 
machine learning models based on Echo State Networks and Reservoir Computing.

It allows to implement more advanced models based on Conceptors and on the Deep Learning 
paradigm such as DeepESN. You will also be able to integrate random recurring models 
into your pytorch models and simply generate time series data for your research.
